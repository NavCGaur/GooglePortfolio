  title="WHO I AM" 
  subtitle="I'm a freelance designer and developer with a passion for creating digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional. With over a decade of experience in the industry, I've had the privilege of working with clients ranging from startups to established enterprises. My approach is rooted in minimalism and clarity. I believe that great design should be invisible—it should serve the user without drawing attention to itself. Every project I undertake is guided by this principle, ensuring that form always follows function. When I'm not designing or coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, reading about design philosophy, or enjoying a quiet moment with a good cup of coffee."

      I believe in the power of simplicity. In a world cluttered with noise, I strive to create digital spaces that are calm, focused, and purposeful. My work is guided by three core principles:

  <PhilosophyItem title="CLARITY">
    Every element should have a clear purpose. If it doesn't serve the user, it doesn't belong.
  </PhilosophyItem>

  <PhilosophyItem title="FUNCTION">
    Form follows function. Beautiful design is useless if it doesn't work seamlessly.
  </PhilosophyItem>

  <PhilosophyItem title="RESTRAINT">
    Less is more. The best solutions often come from knowing what to leave out.
